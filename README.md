# Scratch Font Alteration

Code hosted for Scratch website userstyle that sets font to Fira Code. Works extremely well with Scratch Addons Website dark mode and customizable colors addons using the Dark WWW preset.

Gives the whole of the Scratch website an amazing monospace font called Fira Code, making your installation of [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/) even better!

Requires access to Google Fonts and only works on Scratch, but can work on other websites too. It's recommended to use this with the popular chrome extension/firefox addon [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/)'s `Website dark mode and customizable colors` addons with the `Dark WWW` preset.
